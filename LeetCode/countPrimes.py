        sieve = [True] * (n)
        #find square root of n.

        for i in range(2, sqrtN+1):
            if sieve[i] == True:
                #change any number that is divisible by prime, we change to False
                for j in range(2*i, n, i):
                    sieve[j] = False

        #list comprehension to find primList (Where it still hold True value)
        primeList = [i for i in range(2,n) if sieve[i] == True]

        return len(primeList)
