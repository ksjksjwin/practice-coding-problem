'''
Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).



Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.

class Solution:
    def checkPossibility(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        p = None #position of nums index where we modify when current number is bigger than next number.

        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:
                #if p already modified before, then it will return false automatically.
                if p is not None:
                    return False

                p = i

        return (p is None or p == 0 or p == len(nums)-2 or nums[p-1] <= nums[p+1] or nums[p] <= nums[p+2])
